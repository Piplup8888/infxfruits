    <p><strong>Hi 👋</strong><br>
    You actually got the correct password.</p>
    
 <p>Before you go any further i want to tell you that.</br>
    <p>What’s next is just a letter.</p>
    <p>Please don’t open it out of curiosity.<br>
      Continue only if you are feeling chill and okay.</p>
    <p>I am sorry being doing sm you can leave if you want to.</br>
    <p>I made this purely for timepass, honestly.<br>
    It might make you feel emotional, annoyed, confused, or randomly laugh or even angry lol.<br>
    Or you might get hurt too.</p>
    
    <p>It's funny that it's a proof that if you are here then you too stalk me. <br>
      No worry even I do lol.</p>
    <p>but I’ll be honest though I do miss you.<br>
    Maybe a little.<br>
    Or maybe more.</p>
    <p>Anyway… it’s completely your choice.</p>

    <button class="btn" onclick="location.href='letter.html'">
      Open the letter
    </button>
